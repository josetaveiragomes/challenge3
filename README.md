## Installation and execution 

### Using Node
I recommend the installation of node 14.19.1. After node is installed, run the following commands:

* npm i
* npm run wdio

### Using Docker
In case your prefer to use docker, run the following commands:

* bash docker.sh (you will be inside the docker container after the execution of this command)
* npm i
* npm run wdio
